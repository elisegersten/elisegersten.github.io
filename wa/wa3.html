    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>On March 14, 1876, the Colorado territorial legislature passed an amendment to the state constitution that provided money for the establishment of the University of Colorado in Boulder, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_School_of_Mines">Colorado School of Mines in Golden</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University">Colorado Agricultural College in Fort Collins</a>.</p><!--NOT SURE IF THIS IS RIGHT OR NOT-->
    <p>Two cities competed for the site of the University of Colorado: Boulder and Cañon City. The consolation prize for the losing city was to be the home to the new Colorado State Prison. Cañon City was at a disadvantage as it was already the home of the Colorado Territorial Prison (there are now six prisons in the Cañon City area).</p>
    <p>The cornerstone of the building that became Old Main was laid on September 20, 1875. The doors of the university opened on September 5, 1877. At the time, there were few high schools in the state that could adequately prepare students for university work, so in addition to the university, a preparatory school was formed on campus. In the fall of 1877, the student body consisted of 15 students in the college proper and 50 students in the preparatory school. There were 38 men and 27 women, and their ages ranged from 12 to 23 years.<sup>[19]</sup></p>
    <p>During World War II, Colorado was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.<sup>[20]</sup></p>
    <p>CU hired its first female professor, Mary Rippon, in 1878.<sup>[21]</sup> It hired its first African-American professor, Charles H. Nilon, in 1956, and its first African-American librarian, Mildred Nilon, in 1962.<sup>[22]</sup> Its first African American female graduate, Lucile Berkeley Buchanan, received her degree in 1918.<sup>[23]</sup></p>
